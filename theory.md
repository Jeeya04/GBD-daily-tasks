# Python Programming theory concepts
## 1. What is OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach where programs are designed using objects. Each object represents an entity and contains both data (variables) and behavior (methods). OOP helps make code more organized, reusable, and easier to maintain.

### Core Concepts of OOP
- Abstraction: Showing only necessary details
- Encapsulation: Binding data and methods together
- Inheritance: Reusing features of existing classes
- Polymorphism: Same function behaving differently
## 2. Differences between OOP and Procedural Programming

| Aspect | OOP | Procedural Programming |
|------|-----|----------------|
| Main Focus | Objects and classes | Functions and steps |
| Code Structure | Divided into objects | Divided into functions |
| Data Safety | Better data protection | Less secure |
| Reusability | High due to inheritance | Limited reuse |
| Example Languages | Python, Java | C, Pascal |
## 3. What are the various Data Types and Data Structures used in Python?

Python provides built-in data types such as int, float, string, boolean, and complex.  
Common data structures include list, tuple, set, and dictionary.  
These data structures help in efficient storage, access, and manipulation of data.
## 4. Conditional Statements in Python

Conditional statements are used to execute different blocks of code based on conditions. Python uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for decision-making.
## 5. Loops in Python

Loops allow a block of code to run multiple times. Python mainly uses `for` loops for iterating over sequences and `while` loops for repeated execution based on conditions.
## 6. Functions in Python and Their Uses
Functions are defined blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help in reducing repetition, improving readability, and making programs easier to debug.
## 7. Difference between Class and Object

| Aspect | Class | Object |
|------|-------|--------|
| Definition | A class is a blueprint or template | An object is an instance of a class |
| Purpose | Used to define properties and methods | Used to access and use those properties |
| Memory | Does not occupy memory | Occupies memory when created |
| Creation | Defined using the `class` keyword | Created using the class name |
| Example | `class Student:` | `s1 = Student()` |
